//! Compression algorithms and utilities for OneIO.
//!
//! This module provides a unified interface for reading and writing files with various compression
//! formats, including gzip, bzip2, lz4, xz, and zstd. The available algorithms depend on enabled
//! Cargo features. Utility functions are provided to select the appropriate algorithm based on file
//! suffixes.

/// Returns a compression reader for the given file suffix.
///
/// This function selects the appropriate compression algorithm based on the provided
/// `file_suffix` (such as `"gz"`, `"bz2"`, `"lz4"`, `"xz"`, or `"zst"`), and returns a
/// reader that transparently decompresses data as it is read. If the suffix is not recognized,
/// the original `raw_reader` is returned unchanged.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `raw_reader` - A boxed reader implementing `Read + Send`, typically the source file or stream.
/// * `file_suffix` - The file extension or suffix indicating the compression type.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Ok(Box<dyn Read + Send>)` - A boxed reader that decompresses data on the fly, or the original reader if no compression is detected.
/// * `Err(OneIoError)` - If the compression reader could not be created.
///
/// # Feature Flags
///
/// The available compression algorithms depend on enabled Cargo features:
/// - `"gz"` for gzip
/// - `"bz"` for bzip2
/// - `"lz"` for lz4
/// - `"xz"` for xz/lzma
